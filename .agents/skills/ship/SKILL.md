# Ship Skill

> Triggered by: "ship", "ship this", "ship a feature", "ship it", "ship a change"
>
> **⚠️ This skill MUST be invoked whenever the user says "ship". Do NOT implement changes directly — always go through this workflow. Every step is mandatory and sequential.**

## What This Does

Runs an end-to-end feature shipping workflow: creates a worktree, plans the feature, implements it, validates with an adversarial rubber-duck review, and pushes to a remote branch. All work happens in an isolated worktree — never on `main`.

---

## Parameters

No optional parameters.

## How to Execute

### Step 1: Create a worktree

Invoke the **worktree** skill to create a git worktree for the feature branch.

- Derive a kebab-case branch name from the user's feature description (e.g., "add dark mode toggle" → `add-dark-mode-toggle`), appended to the version number of the base branch if applicable (e.g., `4.0.0` -> `4.0.0--add-dark-mode-toggle`).
- If the user provided an explicit branch name, use that instead.
- Use `ask_user` to confirm the branch name before creating the worktree.

After the worktree is created, all subsequent work happens inside `worktrees/<branch-name>` **at the repository root** (use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find the root). Never create worktrees nested inside other worktrees.

### Step 2: Plan the feature

Generate an implementation plan for the requested feature:

1. Explore the codebase to understand the relevant areas.
2. **Define clear goals** — extract 1–3 concrete, measurable goals from the user's request. Each goal should be a single sentence stating what the change achieves from the user's perspective. These goals are the contract — everything in the plan must serve at least one goal.
3. Write a structured plan to `.github/plans/<branch-name>.md` (inside the worktree).
4. The plan must include:
   - **Goals** — the clear goals defined in step 2 above, numbered
   - **Problem statement** — what the feature does and why
   - **Approach** — high-level strategy
   - **Files to change** — list of files to create, modify, or delete
   - **Steps** — ordered implementation steps with enough detail to execute without referring back to the user's prompt
   - **Edge cases & risks** — anything that could go wrong
5. Present a summary of the plan to the user.
6. Use `ask_user` to confirm:
   > Does this plan look good? Should I proceed with implementation?

Do NOT proceed to Step 3 until the user confirms.

### Step 3: Create clips goal/tasks

**If the `clips` skill is available** (check for `.clips/` directory or `clips` CLI), create tracking issues before implementation begins:

1. Run `clips view` to check for a relevant existing goal.
2. If a matching goal exists, create tasks under it for the planned work.
3. If no matching goal exists, create a new goal with tasks derived from the plan.
4. Save the goal ID and issue number for closure tracking in Step 10.

If clips is not available, skip this step silently.

### Step 4: Implement and commit

Execute the plan:

1. Implement the changes following the plan.
2. Run existing linters and tests (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`) to validate the changes.
3. Fix any issues that arise.
4. Stage and commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>: <description>

<body if needed>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

Use conventional commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).

### Step 5: Write tests

**Invoke the `vitest` skill** to write tests for the implementation:

1. Identify all new or changed logic that is testable (utilities, data transformations, hooks, state management, etc.).
2. Write tests using Vitest, following existing test patterns in the codebase.
3. Run `npm run test` to verify all tests pass (new and existing).
4. Fix any failures.
5. Stage and commit tests separately:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "test: add tests for <feature>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

**Skip this step only if** the change is purely documentation, configuration, or markup with no testable logic.

### Step 6: Adversarial rubber-duck review

Launch a single `rubber-duck` agent with an adversarial framing. Include the plan from Step 2, the diff of all changes (`git diff HEAD~1`), and the feature requirements from the user's original prompt.

**For each changed file**, check if architecture documentation exists at `.agents/architecture/path/to/file/filename.ext.md` and include it as context in the review prompt. This gives the reviewer the documented intent, invariants, and patterns for that file.

The prompt must include:

> You are an adversarial code reviewer. Your job is to BREAK this implementation. Assume nothing works correctly until proven otherwise. Specifically:
>
> 1. **Find bugs** — race conditions, off-by-one errors, null/undefined access, missing error handling
> 2. **Find security issues** — injection, XSS, data leaks, unsafe defaults
> 3. **Find logic errors** — incorrect assumptions, missing edge cases, broken invariants
> 4. **Find integration issues** — does this break existing behavior? Are imports/exports correct? Are types consistent?
> 5. **Find missing tests** — what scenarios are NOT covered?
>
> For each finding, rate severity as CRITICAL (must fix), HIGH (should fix), or LOW (nice to fix).
> Only report CRITICAL and HIGH findings. Ignore style, formatting, and naming.

#### Process findings

1. Apply all CRITICAL fixes immediately.
2. Apply HIGH fixes unless they significantly complicate the implementation without clear benefit.
3. Discard LOW findings.
4. If any changes were made, run lint/build/test again and commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address review findings

<summary of what was fixed>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

5. If no findings required changes, skip the commit.

#### Process findings

1. For each SIGNIFICANT finding, evaluate whether the simplification still achieves all stated goals.
2. Apply simplifications that clearly reduce complexity without sacrificing goals.
3. Discard suggestions that would compromise a goal or introduce fragility.
4. If any changes were made, run lint/build/test again and commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: simplify <area>

<summary of what was simplified>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

5. If no findings required changes, skip the commit.

### Step 7: Update documentation

1. **Invoke the `architecture-scanner` skill** to scan and update architecture docs for any files changed in this feature.
2. Review and update `README.md`, `DOCS.md`, and any other relevant documentation files to reflect the changes made.
3. If any docs were updated, stage and commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: update documentation for <feature>

Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

**Skip this step only if** the change is trivial (typo fix, config tweak) with no user-facing or architectural impact.

### Step 8: Push to remote

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

If the push fails due to permissions or remote issues, inform the user and suggest manual steps.

After pushing, inform the user: "Branch pushed to `origin/<branch-name>`."

### Step 9: Close clips tasks

After the branch is pushed, mark clips tasks as closed:

1. Run `clips view` to find the goal/tasks created in Step 3.
2. Mark them as closed (`clips task status ... closed` / `clips goal status ... closed`).

If clips was skipped in Step 3, skip this step too.

### Step 10: Start dev server

Run the dev server in the worktree so the user can immediately preview changes:

```bash
npx storyboard dev
```

This is the **only** place the dev server starts during a ship workflow — the worktree skill skips its own dev server step when called from ship.

## Rules

- **Always create a worktree first** — invoke the worktree skill as Step 1, before any exploration or implementation. Never commit to `main`. Never create a branch from `main` after the fact. The worktree IS the branch.
- **Never skip the reviews** — both the simplification review and the adversarial rubber-duck review are mandatory quality gates.
- **Always run lint/build/test** before committing — at minimum `npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test`.
- **Always use `ask_user`** for confirmations — branch name and plan approval.
- **Conventional commits** — use `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:` prefixes.
- **Co-authored-by trailer** — every commit must include the Copilot co-author trailer.
- **If any step fails**, stop and inform the user with the error and suggested next steps. Do not silently continue.
- **Context inference** — if the user's prompt already provides the branch name, feature description, or other details, skip the corresponding `ask_user` question and use the provided value directly.

## Example Usage

User says: "ship a feature to add canvas grid snapping"

1. Creates worktree `1.2.0--canvas-grid-snapping`
2. Plans the implementation with clear goals (explores codebase, writes plan)
3. Creates clips goal + tasks for the work
4. Implements grid snapping, commits
5. Writes tests using vitest skill, commits
6. Runs adversarial rubber-duck review, fixes findings, commits
7. Runs adversarial simplification review, simplifies if needed, commits
8. Updates architecture docs, README, DOCS as needed, commits
9. Pushes `1.2.0--canvas-grid-snapping` to origin
10. Marks clips tasks as closed
11. Starts dev server (`npx storyboard dev`) in the worktree
